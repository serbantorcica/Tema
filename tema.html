                <h1 class="title">Rules for Autocomplete</h1>
                <div class="info"> Posted on March 19.2019</div>

                <p>Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but
                so so so many Uls get it wrong. I see this frequently enough that, rather than
                complain about them individually, I though l'd just write down the set of rules they
                often break.</p>

                <p>There may be cases where some of these rules aren't the best thing to do, but there
                should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these
                rules don't apply if a field must be filled with a value from a fixed set, like the list
                of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very least a sane
                experience:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other
                    options must always go below the one matching what they typed.</li>

                    <li>Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type "Fr I want
                    "Fresno" not "San Francisco."</li>

                    <li>After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with
                    substring matches would almost always be the wrong thing to do since users
                    start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.</li>

                    <li>If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subscquence
                    matching. This is only useful in some cases.</li>

                    <li>If there are no subsequence'substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
                    approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.</li>

                    <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>

                    <li>When one option is the prefix of another, put the shortest one first.</li>

                    <li>The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two options
                    that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer the one that more
                    closely matches the user's input.</li>

                    <li>The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must be a
                    different key than the action to accept the first suggestion unless you have to
                    something first to start using autocomplete suggestions (e.g. hit the down
                    arrow). The user should never have to take extra steps to not use
                    autocomplete.</li>
